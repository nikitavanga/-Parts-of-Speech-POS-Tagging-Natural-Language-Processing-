# -Parts-of-Speech-POS-Tagging-Natural-Language-Processing-

This project aims to create a system that could automatically identify the part of speech, noun, verb, adjective, etc., for any given English word. This is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with applications in sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. 
I built and evaluated three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction, and Logistic Regression with Word2Vec for incorporating semantic information.
